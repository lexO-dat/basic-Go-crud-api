Hi!, this is a basic crud program made in go that makes a simple task list app.
The library that i used in this code id the gorilla mux (github.com/gorilla/mux)

-> To initialize the code run: go mod init [name of the project, in this case doesnt matter]
-> To install the gorilla mux library run: go get github.com/gorilla/mux
